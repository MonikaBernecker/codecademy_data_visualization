#WHO Life Expectancy and GDP Data Analysis
This project conducts an analysis of the life expectancy and GDP data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). It serves as a portfolio project for Codecademy.

#Overview
The main objective of this analysis is to explore the relationship between a country's GDP and the life expectancy of its citizens. By examining data from the WHO, we aim to draw insights and conclusions on how economic growth might influence health and well-being.

#Data Sources
The primary data for this analysis is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) database, which provides comprehensive statistics on global health metrics, including life expectancy and GDP.

#Project Structure
data/: Contains the data files provided from codecademy.
notebooks and visualization/: Jupyter notebook
